# Examplle: multinode on openstack pre-provisioned by traas

Follow an [all-in-one undercloud example guide](./docs/rdocloud-guide.md)
(RDO cloud), or read below for advanced deployment scenarios.

> **NOTE** the private key from the generated Nova keypair should be
> copied under the ``$LWD`` path.

Update the ``vars/inventory-traas.yaml`` vars file with required info, like
OpenStack cloud access secrets and endpoints. Now you need to generate an
ansible inventory for the undercloud/overcloud VMs on OpenStack (see
also [Traas](https://github.com/bogdando/traas)):
```
$ export PLAY=oooq-traas.yaml
```
Make sure there are no artificial/obsolete node entries remaining at the
``$LWD/hosts`` (or just remove the file) and run:
```
$ ./oooq-warp.sh
(oooq) create_env_oooq.sh
```
Note, it places the given openstack cloud provider access secrets under the
``$LWD/clouds.yaml`` or ``$LWD/stackrc``. The ``$LWD`` dir is bind-mounted
into the wrapper container and is persisted across different containers runs.

Then deploy with custom tripleo-extras roles, like:
```
(oooq) export PLAY=oooq-traas-under.yaml
(oooq) create_env_oooq.sh
(oooq) export PLAY=oooq-traas-over.yaml
(oooq) export CONTROLLER_HOSTS="<private_v4_1> ... <private_v4_N>"
(oooq) export SUBNODES_SSH_KEY=/home/centos/.ssh/id_rsa
(oooq) create_env_oooq.sh
```
Note, the deployed-server configuration task requires a few env vars to be
exported to contain the pre-provisioned environment specific values (see
[deployed-server](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-docs/advanced_deployment/deployed_server.html)
docs for details), like (Traas specific provisioning scripts) ssh key path,
deployed servers' IPs.
Use the ``openstack --os-cloud my-cool-cloud server list`` outputs to get
a list of controllers/computes/etc private IPs for export.
SSH keys placement is up to cloud init scripts for the pre-provisioned hosts.
Traas creates them under the centos user home by default.
